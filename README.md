    ## 2                                                                                                  Dies in Secret Invasion V1:I8. Actually was sent tto Microverse later recovered
    ## 3 Death: "Later while under the influence of Immortus Stark committed a number of horrible acts and was killed.'  This set up young Tony. Franklin Richards later brought him back
    ## 4                                                                               Dies in Ghosts of the Future arc. However "he had actually used a hidden Pantheon base to survive"
    ## 5                                                      Dies in Fear Itself brought back because that's kind of the whole point. Second death in Time Runs Out has not yet returned
    ## 6                                                                                                                                                                             <NA>

Get the data into a format where the five columns for Death\[1-5\] are
replaced by two columns: Time, and Death. Time should be a number
between 1 and 5 (look into the function `parse_number`); Death is a
categorical variables with values “yes”, “no” and ““. Call the resulting
data set `deaths`.

Similarly, deal with the returns of characters.

Based on these datasets calculate the average number of deaths an
Avenger suffers.
